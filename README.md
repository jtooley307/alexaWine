#README for Alexa Wine Skill - Modernized

A robust Alexa skill that allows users to search for wines and get detailed information about them. This skill has been completely modernized with security fixes, error handling, and best practices.

## ðŸš€ Key Improvements

### Security & Configuration
- âœ… **Environment Variables**: API keys and configuration moved to environment variables
- âœ… **HTTPS**: All external API calls use secure HTTPS connections
- âœ… **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation and sanitization of user input
- âœ… **No Hardcoded Secrets**: API keys are properly externalized

### Architecture & Dependencies
- âœ… **Modern SDK**: Upgraded from deprecated alexa-sdk v1 to ask-sdk-core v2
- âœ… **Node.js 18.x**: Updated from outdated Node.js 4.3 runtime
- âœ… **Modular Design**: Code split into logical modules (config, utils, services)
- âœ… **Proper Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

### Robustness & Reliability
- âœ… **Session Management**: Uses session attributes instead of global variables
- âœ… **Timeout Handling**: HTTP requests have proper timeout and retry logic
- âœ… **Structured Logging**: Proper logging with different log levels
- âœ… **Graceful Degradation**: Skill handles API failures gracefully
